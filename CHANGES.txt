Changes
=======

1.3 (unreleased)
----------------

* ...

1.2 (2008-05-04)
----------------

* Ported directives to Martian's new directive implementation.  As a
  result, nearly all helper functions that were available from
  ``grokcore.component.util`` have been removed.  The functionality is
  mostly available from the directives themselves now.

* The ``baseclass`` directive has been moved to Martian.

* The ``order`` directive and its helper functions have been moved
  back to Grok, as it was of no general use, but very specific to
  viewlets.

1.1 (2008-05-03)
----------------

* ``determine_module_component`` now looks for classes that implement
  a certain interface (such as ``IContext``), instead of taking a list
  of classes.  If looking for ``IContext``, it still will find
  ``Context`` subclasses, as these were also made to implement
  ``IContext``.

* Move the ``public_methods_from_class`` helper function back to Grok,
  it isn't used at all in ``grokcore.component``.

1.0.1 (2008-05-02)
------------------

* The grokkers for adapters and global utilities did not use the
  correct value for the *provided* interface in the configuration
  action discriminator.  Because of this, uninformative and
  potentially wrong conflict errors would occur, as well as no
  conflict where a conflict should have occurred.

* The grokker for the ``global_utility()`` directive did immediate
  registrations instead of generating configuration actions.
  Therefore it did not provoke ``ConflictErrors`` for conflicting
  registrations.

* Improved documentation

1.0 (2008-05-01)
----------------

* Created ``grokcore.component`` in March 2008 by factoring basic
  component base classes and their directives and grokkers out of
  Grok.
