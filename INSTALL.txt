Preparing for grok development
------------------------------

Install setuptools on your system, or use a setuptools-based
environment like a "virtualenv" or a "buildout", and then install
"grokcore.component".  Doing it from the command line looks like::

    $ sudo pip install -U grokcore.component

Then you can try importing it from your Python code.

Running the tests
-----------------

To run the "grokcore.component" tests, you need to download the source
code from version control, install ``tox`` and run the following command::

    $ tox
