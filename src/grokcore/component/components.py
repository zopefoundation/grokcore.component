    Use the ``context`` directive to specify which object to adapt and the

    will provide. If it's a named multi-adapter, you may use the ``name``
    directive to specify the name.

    Note that contrary to the Adapter, the MultiAdapter base class does not
    provide an `__init__` method. An `__init__` needs to accept the same number

    Base class for a globally registered utility. Unless you use the ``direct``

    utility, the class will automatically be instantiated, therefore the
    constructor may not take any arguments. Use the ``implements`` directive to
    specify which interface the utility provides, or if that is not
    unambiguous, also use the ``provides`` directive to specify which of the
    implemented interfaces should be used when registering the utility. If it's
    a named utility, you may use the ``name`` directive to specify the name.

    Use the ``context`` directive to explicitly set the interface to adapt
    from. When omitted the current context is assumed. Use the ``implements``

    is not unambiguous, also use the ``provides`` directive to specify which of
